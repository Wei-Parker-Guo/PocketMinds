# PocketMinds

PocketMinds is a realtime communication app designed to help thinkers work together for solutions. All conversations are nurtured under an "Ask-and-Discuss" pattern: users join collectively to analyze and provide answers for the questioners. With the increasing complexity of problems and solutions needed today, we hope PocketMinds can serve as everyone's mobile think tank in a world full of intellectual challenges.

## Supported Platforms

Currently PocketMinds is being actively developed for Android OS.
